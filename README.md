# Radical-Clone
A simple radical style clone made using the Phaser framework. The game was made as a demonstration of some of Phaser's features as well as little taster project for my beginnings into Phaser development. The game makes a basic implemented use of Phaser states, and utilises many foundational Phaser functions as well as some of the more advanced features of JavaScript prototypes. All code contained within is heavily commented for beginners and general clarity.

[Game made using (Phaser version 2.4.6) minified version.]
